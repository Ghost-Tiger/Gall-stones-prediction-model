# Logistic Regression Model: Gallstone-1 Dataset

This repository contains a machine learning project that uses a logistic regression model to predict the presence of gallstones based on patient data.

## Overview

The model is built using scikit-learn and is trained on the Gallstone-1 dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The primary objective is to classify whether a patient has gallstones (`1`) or not (`0`) based on various clinical attributes.

## Dataset

- Source: [UCI Machine Learning Repository – Gallstone-1](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/1150/gallstone-1)
- Description: This dataset includes diagnostic features extracted from patient records to determine the presence of gallstones.
- Target variable: Presence of gallstones (binary classification: 0 = no gallstones, 1 = gallstones).

If you want to run the notebook locally, download the dataset from the [UCI link](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/1150/gallstone-1), and place the CSV file in the root directory of this project. You may need to preprocess or convert the file format before use.
